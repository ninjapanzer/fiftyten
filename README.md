#Fifty/Ten

A (TO-BE) Social app to help manage 50/10 work sprints.

Phase 1 - 50/10 will display a clock that alerts us of our progress in the current sprint
Phase 2 - Allow for discussion about what you did during your sprint and downtime
Phase 3 - Let User define feeds/readinglists to track during the sprint for categorized review during the 10 minute break
Phase 4 - Learn User behaviors so items can be sorted by expected reading priority
